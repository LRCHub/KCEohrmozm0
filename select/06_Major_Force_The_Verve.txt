Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Beneath the apple tree
You come and squared your trouble
Be my blues

And you created
There'd be a rather dirty thing by a lady
You bet you merely went sliding snakes and saints
Lying about his current disgrace
Into morning crying
About all the things I wished I watched about the life
About the life

Taking a ride, ride, yeah
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na

Adventurer was hiding
With nobody in sight
Oh, when it crossed my mind, push
You see me in the eye, die, I said die

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
